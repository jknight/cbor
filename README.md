# cbor

JavaScript implementation of the CBOR [RFC 7049](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7049).

This library provides the [recommended API](http://cbor.io/impls.html)

```js
import CBOR from "cbor";

const encoded = CBOR.encode(json);
const decoded = CBOR.decode(encoded);
```

### Notes

There are a few things from the specification which are currently unimplemented:

-   Byte strings
-   Tags, and the items they represent:
    -   date/time, bignum/bigfloat as byte string, and others
-   16-bit float (IEEE754 binary16)
-   Numbers larger than 32 bit (and BigInt)

These weren't required in my case, but if you need one or more of these features, submit an [issue](https://github.com/jprochazk/cbor/issues), and I'll implement it! :)
